### Social Media presence
We maintain fan pages within various social networks and platforms with the aim of communicating with active customers, interested parties and users and informing them about our services there. 
We would like to point out that your personal data may be processed worldwide, so that risks may arise for you (e.g. in enforcing your rights under your local law).
User data is generally processed for market research and advertising purposes. For example, usage profiles can be created from user behavior and the resulting interests of users. 
These usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the platforms that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the user's computer, in which the user's usage behavior and interests are stored. In addition, data may also be stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them). The processing of users' personal data is based on our legitimate interests in effective user information and communication with users.
For more information on the processing of your personal data and your objection options, please refer to the links of the respective provider listed below. The assertion of information and other rights of the data subjects can also be made against the providers, who then only have direct access to the data of the users and have the corresponding information.
